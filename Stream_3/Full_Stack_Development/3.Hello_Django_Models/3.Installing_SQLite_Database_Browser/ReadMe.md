### INSTALLING SQLITE DATABASE BROWSER

Let’s have a look at what tables are installed. To do that, we’ll download
the **SQLite Database Browser**, the free GUI tool used for working with SQLite
databases easily and directly.

1.  Go to [sqlitebrowser.org](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)

2.  Download and install the version that matches your operating system.

1.  Once installed, run the application and navigate to the **sqlite.db** file
    in our project via the “**Open Database**” button.

1.  Once you have located the **sqlite.db** file and opened it, you should see
    your default database tables plus a table called **ModelTest_app_contact**.
    This is our newly created contact table prefixed with our app name. Expand
    the tree node icon beside the table name to see the fields, their datatypes,
    and their constraints.

2.  Notice that Django automatically created a primary key.
