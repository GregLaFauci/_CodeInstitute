CHALLENGE
=========

 

Play around with the various aspects of the examples you have used. Explore the
tweepy docs and the API methods at
 <http://tweepy.readthedocs.org/en/v2.3.0/index.html>

 

NOTE
----

Some of the API methods allow you to create, modify, and delete tweets.  Be
careful when writing to the Twitter stream, as your test information will be out
in the world available for all to see. If you do want to go ahead with some
write tests, modify your twitter app to have read and write access rather than
read only access.
