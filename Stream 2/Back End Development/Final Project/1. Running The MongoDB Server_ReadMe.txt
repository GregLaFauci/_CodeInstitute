To whoever may use this project, these are a few steps that will aid you in getting the project up and running.

• Firstly, you will need MongoDB installed
• You should then simply be able to run this command in a terminal/cmd window

'mongod --config [PATH]\_mongoDB_data\_config\_mongodb_config.conf'

NOTE: You will need to ammend the path as neccessary to suit where you extracted the file too.
