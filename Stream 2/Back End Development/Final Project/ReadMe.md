### **Project name**: 

Code Institute - Stream 2 Final Project. “Avengers Data Dashboard”

 

### **Description**: 

The Avengers data dashboard is just that. It is a dashboard to display different
types of Avengers information in the form of graphs, bar charts, pie charts,
table and more, using technologies such as Flask, DC.js, D3.js, Python, MongoDB
and more. If you would like to see the project brief for a full breakdown of
what I was instructed to do then please refer to the [Project
Brief](ProjectBrief.md) file.

 

### **Installation**: 

Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to
install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even
more clear for other people.

 

### **Usage**: 

The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your
project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include
screenshots of your project in action.

 

### **Contributing**: 

Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which
contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If
you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other
developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to
help others contribute, check out the guide for (setting guidelines for
repository
contributors)[https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/].

 

### **Credits**: 

Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of
your project.

 

### **License**: 

Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information
on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s [licensing
guide](http://choosealicense.com/)!
