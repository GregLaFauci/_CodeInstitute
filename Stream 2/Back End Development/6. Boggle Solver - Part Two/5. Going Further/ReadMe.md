 

CHALLENGE
=========

 

Think about why
the **is\_a\_real\_word** [function](http://codeinstitute.wpengine.com/glossary/function/) was
introduced. Do we still need
a [function](http://codeinstitute.wpengine.com/glossary/function/)? Can we just
inline the code back into
the **do\_search** [function](http://codeinstitute.wpengine.com/glossary/function/)?
What are the pros and cons of doing this?

 

Please Note:

 

My actual solution will follow in the near future, due to work and time
restrictions I will be rushing through the course to get the content complete
and coming back to the solutions at a later date. Thanks
