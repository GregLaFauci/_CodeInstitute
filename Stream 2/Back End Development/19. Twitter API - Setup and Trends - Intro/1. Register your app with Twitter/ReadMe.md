[CALLBACK URL](http://lms.codeinstitute.net/course-status/#collapse_gcdxgi)

For now, ignore the Callback
URL [field](http://lms.codeinstitute.net/glossary/field/). If you are allowing
users to log into your app to authenticate themselves, you’d enter the URL where
they would be returned after they’ve given permission to Twitter to use your
app. Your app won’t include third-party users logging in.

1.   Create your access token.

The default access type when you create a Twitter app is read only.  As our app
will only be concerned with reading existing tweets, you can go with the default
setting. You can change the access type to “Read and Write” to be able to read
Twitter data and send tweets, and select “Read, Write and access direct
messages” if you want to have access to your direct messages.  

1.  Remember
    your [OAUTH](http://lms.codeinstitute.net/glossary/oauth/) Settings.

The Twitter API imposes limitations on the amount of data you can use.

**Rate limit:**
