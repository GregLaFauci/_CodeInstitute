CHALLENGE
=========

 

Deploy the changes to Heroku and play around with **drfdocs**. It will be
available at **https://\<your heroku app\>.herokuapp.com/docs/**.

 

Our API is now complete. Update your Angular app to work with your very own API
hosted on Heroku. Play around with the app and see if there’s any extra features
you can add in there.

 

Remember, because of the way that an API works, we can access it with any
language or tool – not just JavaScript!
