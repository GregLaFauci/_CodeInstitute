### CHALLENGE A

-   Open your we_are_social project and activate your virtualenv so you can
    install your new app.

-   Make sure that your project includes a **base.html** template that loads the
    Bootstrap css and js (as well as jQuery). This is a dependency for our blog
    app.

-   Now that you’ve got that ready, we can install the app:

-   Do not forget to put `git+https://github.com//reusable_blog_app.git` into
    your requirements.txt file.

 

### CHALLENGE B

-   Using the README.rst instructions, complete the installation of the package
    into your project.

 

Now once we fire up our we_are_social project, we have a whole new section for
blogs just by simply reusing code we wrote ages ago!

 

See we_are_social project for the challenge solutions implemented.
