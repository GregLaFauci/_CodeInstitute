Creating Forum Polls – Intro
============================

##### In this lesson the students will learn how to integrate polls into their forum to allow their users to vote on topics

 

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the end of this unit, you’ll know:

-   What taking polls requires in terms of data models

-   How to show parts of a Django form based on the user’s actions

-   What the process of taking a poll requires to be accurate

 

If at any point you run into any issues with your code, you can return to this
starting point by following these steps:

In the terminal run the following commands:

-   git clone <https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/we_are_social.git>

-   cd we_are_social

-   git checkout forum

Make sure you have a virtualenv setup in Pycharm. You’ll have to update the
requirements.txt file by using `git+https://github.com/<your github id
here>/reusable_blog_app.git` instead of the link that’s already there. Once
that’s done you can go ahead and install the dependencies from
‘requirements.txt.’

Run python manage.py migrate
