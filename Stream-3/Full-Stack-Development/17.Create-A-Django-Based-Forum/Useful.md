If at any point you run into any issues with your code, you can return to this
starting point by following these steps:

In the terminal run the following commands:

-   git
    clone [https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/we_are_social.git](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/we_are_social)

-   cd we_are_social

-   git checkout reusable_blog

Make sure you have a virtualenv setup in Pycharm. You’ll have to update the
requirements.txt file by using `git+https://github.com/<your github id
here>/reusable_blog_app.git` instead of the link that’s already there. Once
that’s done, you can go ahead and install the dependencies from
‘requirements.txt.’

Run python manage.py migrate
