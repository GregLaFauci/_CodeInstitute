This lesson was reading only about normalisation and what it is, it does contain
a few challenges below.

 

CHALLENGE
=========

 

### Challenge A

Extend your people table to include information about credit cards, including
card type, card number, expiry date, and CVV number (the 3 digits on the back).

 

### Challenge B

Create a set of tables to solve the problem of a person having more than one
credit card. Ensuring you normalise the data correctly to remove redundancy.

 

### Challenge C

If a person also has multiple jobs, how could
you [record](http://codeinstitute.wpengine.com/glossary/record/) that in tables?

 

Please Note:

 

My actual solution will follow in the near future, due to work and time
restrictions I will be rushing through the course to get the content complete
and coming back to the solutions at a later date. Thanks
